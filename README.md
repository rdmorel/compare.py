# compare.py

This is a python metaprogram I wrote that uses the TeamBots architecture (from TeamBots.org) to run multiple simulations of robots with different control schemas trying to navigate to a goal on multiple maps, then map by map sorts them by the time it took to navigate the obstacles in order to find the most efficient control schema for each individual map.
